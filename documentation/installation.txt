C++ Installation for MacOS

Requires a text-editor/IDE like Visual Studio Code

In terminal:
xcode-select --install
A popup will appear, click install. This downloads clang++, the C++ compiler.

clang++ --version 
This will check to make sure the installation was succesful.

Install VSCode and go to extensions. Download the C++ extension made by Microsoft. 
Create a file using the file extension .cpp

To compile and run code, open terminal and type:
clang++ file_name.cpp -o file_name
And then:
./file_name
