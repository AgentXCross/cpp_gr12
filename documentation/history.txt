1. Was there a parent language?
Yes, the parent language of C++ is C. C was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie.
C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s. It was originally called "C with classes".
It still maintains compatibility with most C code.

2. Was there a specific problem it was trying to solve?
Yes, C++ was created to add object-oriented programming (OOP) features to C.
C didn't have classes and inheritance (classes inheriting from other classes). 
Bjarne Stroustrup wanted the fast performance and low-level control of C with organization offered by OOP. 
He was first inspired by Simula, the first OOP language that had good design but low efficiency.
The overall goal was to make it easier to manage complex software systems while maintaining efficiency.
